Hosting information regarding the CCoE Cloud Journey Service

Shared Responsibilities of 
Ginnie Mae CAMO cloud uses DMC3 (Deloitte Multi-Cloud Command Center) as a self-service platform for developers to provision cloud resources such as EC2 instances, databases, File stores, and load balancers. Available resource types are listed in the CAMO Services Guide. The CAMO team will be responsible for provisioning networking resources, such as VPCs, subnets, and internet gateways. For requested resources that currently do not exist within the CAMO Service Guide (DMC3), prior approval from Ginnie Mae is required to use the resources in the architecture, and the CAMO team will be responsible for deploying the resources.

It is important to note that incoming project teams will NOT have access to the AWS console and will provision all resources through DMC3 self-service or through the CAMO team.
